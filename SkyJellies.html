            <h1>Sky Jellies</h1>
            <p>
                An experimental unity game about exploring and taking care of creatures called Jellies. This prototype was created by P1-OC, and I had a hand in assisting in development along with many other developers.

                            <li>Using already created inventory systems, I developed a way for players to drop items in their inventory.</li>
                            <li>Developed an item removal system to ensure that items would get removed from the inventory when tossed.</li>
                            <li>Integrated the item collection system so that when dropped items were walked over, the same item and amount would be returned to the player.</li>

                            <li>Transformed the CharacterController into RigidBody to improve player movement to make physics feel less floaty and more responsive.</li>
                            <li>Reworked the jump systems to allow for coyote time.</li>
                            <li>Additionally added a system that would detect if the jump input was pressed while airborn to allow for a delayed jump if the player was going to hit the ground within a certain time.</li>

                            <li>Created a hotbar so that players could drag items from their inventory to the hotbar in order to interact with the environment.</li>
                            <li>Pressing the number keys 1,2, and 3 would select items within that slot.</li>
                            <li>Item model and texture automatically display when the item is held in the hotbar.</li>
