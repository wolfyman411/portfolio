        <p>
            A community driven mod for Half-Life 2 Episode 2 that attempts to retell the story of the cut expansion Half-Life 2 Episode 3. The team's current size is 22 volunteers who spend their free time working on the project when they can.

            <h1>What I Did</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        I was the overall lead of the project, making sure that people know what they needed to do, and what we had left to complete. I was also responsible for keeping the team friendly with one another, and taking members aside in private in order to prevent potential infighting.

        </div>
        <p>Programmed a melee weapon with a charging secondary attack. I integrated the animations and model into the game as well.</p>
        <h3>HoundEye</h3>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img id="gifImage" src="Media/Projects/IF/houndeye.gif"class="img-border-white" onclick="toggleGif(event)" style="display: none; cursor: pointer;">

        </div>
        <p>Ported an NPC from an older version of the engine, fixed older bugs from the npc, and gave it additional functionality so that mappers could setup additional sequences with them.</p>
        <h3>Task Management</h3>
        <p>I was in charge of making sure everyone knew what they were doing, keeping tabs on tasks and their progress, as well as keeping everyone focused on a central vision.</p>
        <h3>Articles</h3>
        <p>Every 2-3 months the team creates a developer article to keep the fan base up to date with progress. I was in charge of collecting everything we had done as a team, and writing the first draft of the article.</p>
