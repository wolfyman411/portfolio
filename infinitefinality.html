        </div>
        <p>
            The goal of the project was to create the cancelled Episode 3 from the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2, and its' subsequent Episode expansions based off of leaks and information gathered from previous Valve developers.
            While most mods of a similar type attempt to recreate something as if it was in modern day, the goal for this mod was to create something as if it was released on time.

            <h1>The Team</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            The team is filled with both experienced and inexperienced developers, coming from a wide range of abilities and time zones. This is a passion project for all of us, meaning nobody was paid to do anything.
            The team stands at a strong 22 members, and we are still growing even today.

        <p>
            I am the sole programmer of the mod, as well as the director. I facilitate tasks, ensuring tasks are completed and keeping up to date with volunteers. I am also responsible for arranging meetings, organizing documents, keeping
            members on track, keeping our scope low, onboarding new members, and prepping for community announcements.
