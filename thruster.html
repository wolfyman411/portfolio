                Thruster is an Unity game developed entirely by me. It is an arcade racer with complex AI racers.

                            <li>When determining what race position racers are in, internal logic will place racers based on how many laps and checkpoints the racer has completed. If racers have the same number of checkpoints and laps, it will put the racer closest to the current checkpoint in front.</li>
                            <li>When a race is completed by the player, racers will get points based on their position and their scores will carry onto the next race.</li>
                            <li>Along with racers saved points, AI personalities will also carry over to the next race.</li>
